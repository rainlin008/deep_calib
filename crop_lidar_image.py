  Note that the method doesn't assume we know the input image size but it does

  Args:
    image: an image of shape [height, width, channels].
    offset_height: a scalar tensor indicating the height offset.
    offset_width: a scalar tensor indicating the width offset.
    crop_height: the height of the cropped image.

  Returns:
